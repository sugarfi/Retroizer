# Retroizer
Basically, a CLI tool to make images look retro.<br/>
<hr/>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
The most basic thing you can do with Retroizer is
retroize a file. Let's say you have a file, hobbes.gif.
It looks like this:<br/>
<img src="hobbes.gif"/><br/>
To view a retroized version, simply run<br/>
<code>python3 retroizer.py hobbes.gif</code><br/>
You should see something like this (I aim to fix the glitchy colors in future versions:<br/>
<img src="retro_hobbes.png"/><br/>
<hr/>
Well, that's all well and good, but what if <u><i><b>you</b></i></u>
want to be retroized? Do you take a picture of
yourself and retroize it? No! Webcam to the rescue!
If you just put "webcam" for the filename, a
live stream will be used for retroization.
All you need to do is something like this:<br/>
<code>python3 retroizer.py webcam</code></br/>
